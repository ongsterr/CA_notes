- FHIL - **Stages of Design Thinking** - watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFffb2H-gK0)!
    - ```Empathy``` - true understanding of what our users are experiencing
    - ```Reframe```
    - ```Ideate/Brainstorm``` - quantity of ideas over quality
        - The best ideas come from the users' needs
    - ```Prototyping``` - create a visual interpretation of your ideas
    - ```Testing``` - tweaking prototype based on feedbacks
- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto2018.github.io/) - **12 Principles of Agile**:
    - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through ```early and continuous delivery``` of valuable software.
    - Welcome ```changing requirements```, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
    - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    - Build projects around ```motivated individuals```. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is ```face-to-face conversation```.
    - Working software is the primary measure of ```progress```.
    - Agile processes promote ```sustainable development```. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    - Continuous attention to ```technical excellence``` and ```good design``` enhances agility.
    - ```Simplicity``` - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
    - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from ```self-organizing teams```.
    - At regular intervals, the team ```reflects``` on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

- "[Design Thinking for Startups](https://hackernoon.com/design-thinking-for-startups-by-nitin-sethi-of-quikr-fe01a259c9bf)" by [Nitin Sethi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connect2nitin/)
    - What is A/B Testing? See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing).
        - A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable typically by testing a subject's response to variable A against variable B, and determining which of the two variables is more effective.
    - Few **Handy Tips for Startup**:
        - Translate your content into more local languages for organic growth.
        - Do a lot of ```A/B testing```
        - Understanding the ```UX``` as a critical component is imperative
        - Lack of ```customer-centric``` approach can kill your business fast
        - Design Thinking is the ```stage zero``` of your product development lifecycle
        - Be curious, keep exploring and thrive to ```improve```
        - ```Treat customers like assets```, not like transactions

    - Design thinking refers to ```creative strategies``` designers use during the process of identifying problems designing solutions.
    - According to Tim Brown, author and CEO of world renowned design consultancy, IDEO, 

    > “Design thinking is a ```human-centered``` approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the ```needs of people```, the ```possibilities of technology```, and the ```requirements for business success```.”
 
    - The ```lean startup methodology``` owes its roots to Toyota’s lean production system and the US Department of Defence’s OODA philosophy (observe, orient, decide, act, which is also fundamental in agile). But while Toyota’s system teaches us how to ```builds things efficiently```, it doesn’t teach us ```what to build``` in the first place.
    - The lean startup is used to rapidly experiment across problem, solution, customer segment, distribution channels, marketing channels, revenue models, cost structures, messaging and so on in order to complete the puzzle that underpins any idea for as Michael Dell put it,
    > "Ideas are a commodity, execution of them is not."

    - By combining design thinking, the lean startup and agile, you are far more likely to not only come up with better ideas but turn those ideas into viable money makers and deliver them in a way that creates immediate value for customers, doesn’t result in cost and schedule blowouts — synonymous with innovation at large companies — and give your employees the opportunity to partake in more rewarding and fulfilling work.
    - This last point is key, all of these methods engage users in a frequent feedback loop so we can measure progress and adapt so that we are maximising value creation.

## **User Stories**

**Reading**
- "[User Stories: A Foundation for UI Design](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/user-stories-a-foundation-for-ui-design/)"
    - User Stories ccomplished three main things:
        - User stories keep products user focused
        - User stories promote cooperation between team members
        - User stories help prevent feature creep and design dead-ends
    - What is a "User Story"?
        - User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
        > As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
    - Stay User Focused
        - When we identify user stories first, we let them dictate the design rather than the other way around
        - Designers tend to fall into the trappings of a technical approach, especially after working for hours on functionality , and user stories help remind us to stay focused on the user experience which consequently gives the app its character.
    - Promote Cooperation
    - Prevent feature creep and design dead-ends
        - It refers to the tendency to want to keep adding more capabilities and expanding the scope of a project, whether hardware or software.

    - Next Steps
        - Identify a full set of ```user stories``` before doing any visual design. Resisting the temptation to jump straight into designing may save time and headaches and lots of wasted effort.
        - For each user story, see if it can be broken down into smaller, more specific stories. “Epics” are fine for a high-level overview of the needed features, but don’t leave things too broad. Drill down to the specifics early on, and solve usability problems at the outset.
        - Never put a design element in an interface that doesn’t have a corresponding user story. Documenting the what and why of each element promotes organization and makes the handoff to the development team much smoother.

**Working with [Trello](https://trello.com/#)**
- Group activity working on User Story in Trello on ```Boot Scoot```
- Basically creating a variety of personas (ideally key target market) and identifying their user needs to interviews, research or surveys
- Then create key user stories which will then be a backing to a product features (prioritisation is important here!)
- Attach each user story to a product feature which will then be split into task to be worked on
