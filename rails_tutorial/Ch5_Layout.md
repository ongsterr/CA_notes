## Chapter 5: Filling in the Layout
## **What We Learnt**
- Using HTML5, we can define a site layout with logo, header, footer, and main body content
- Rails partials are used to place markup in a separate file for convenience
- CSS allows us to style the site layout based on CSS classes and ids
- The Bootstrap framework makes it easy to make a nicely designed site quickly
- Sass and the asset pipeline allow us to eliminate duplication in our CSS while packaging up the results efficiently for production
- Rails allows us to define custom routing rules, thereby providing named routes
- Integration tests effectively simulate a browser clicking from page to page
