## **Working with Stripe and PostgreSQL**

### **Using PostgreSQL**
1. Install PostgreSQL using the [guide](https://www.mirrorcommunications.com/blog/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-windows-10-with-postgresql) by Mirror.
    - Note that you need to include your username and password in the database.yml file in ```config``` folder
2. To use PostgreSQL on terminal using ```psql``` - see [docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04)
    - See [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html) for ```psql``` commands.

### **Using Stripe**
- Include "[stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby)" gem in your Gemfile
- Refer to [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/rails) to set up payment checkout Stripe in Rails app
- Using webhook - what is a [webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks)?
    - Use webhooks to be notified about events that happen in a Stripe account

### **Using Heroku**
- What is [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5) used for?
    - Heroku allows you to deploy your Rails app through git quickly
- To set up config variables in Heroku, see [docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

### **Other Notes**
- What is the "[Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/)" framework?
    - **Phoenix** is a web development framework written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) which implements the server-side MVC pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Pythonâ€™s Django.

    ```ruby
    search = params[:search] # This gives you what was inputted for "search"
    Product.where(name: search)

    # An example of how CSV can be incorporated into Ruby - read the docs
