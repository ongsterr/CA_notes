- Age demographics
    - 69% of consumers who book a tour or activity via TrekkSoft are aged 34 or younger. Within this age range, the majority of bookings are made by 25 to 34 year-olds.

- When are bookings being made?
    - 59% of travellers begin researching their next trip between one and three months before departure, according to [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/TripAdvisorInsights/w797)
    - Data from [Phocuswright](https://www.phocuswright.com/Travel-Research/Destination-Activities-Marketing/Tours-amp-Activities-Come-of-Age-Global-Travel-Activities-Marketplace-2014-2020) shows how 38% of tour and activity bookings are happening on the same day or up to two days before the activity. Many of these bookings take place in-destination, while consumers are already travelling. Only 19% of these activities were booked more than a month in advance.

- Market Analysis

    Type | Behavior 
    --- | ---
    **Millennials** | Most millennial travelers are looking for services that are easy to find and book. Make sure your services are well-represented on review sites such as TripAdvisor
    **Generation X** | Most Gen X are looking for the opportunity to relax and unwind. They prefer family or group focused options. They value the option to work while on vacation. They also prefer uncomplicated travel.
    **Baby Boomers** | 57% of Boomers travel to spend time with loved ones according to a [report](https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2017-travel-trends.pdf) from AARP. 39% take trips to step outside of their everyday life.

- The Sharing Economy
    > In a 2014 study, 44% of the adult population in the US said they were familiar with the `sharing economy`.

    > “I think there’s an outdated image of a tour guide with an umbrella and an anorak boring the pants off people – that’s changed now. And the change is only going to be more pronounced through the success of [Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com.au/host/experiences) and the gig economy phenomenon that anybody is quite possibly and potentially an `experience leader` or a `tour guide`. This ties in nicely with the increased desire of millennials for something more seemingly authentic, more seemingly local, more seemingly unique.”

    What exactly is `Airbnb Experiences` offering?

### **Problem Background**
See below the **typical process flow** for planning a travel abroad from the `travellers' perspective`:
1. Decide on a country or place to visit
2. Check out flight tickets from various airlines through services like [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/#flt=/m/0chgzm..2018-05-14*./m/0chgzm.2018-05-18;c:AUD;e:1;sd:1;t:h) and book the `best value` ones. (Normally 3 months before trip)
    > Normally, booking is done directly with the airline/agent. (`Transaction #1`)
3. Book accomodation (Normally 2-3 months before trip)
    - First, go to Trip Advisors to get a feel of the average price of a hotel
    - Second, go to Airbnb to get a feel of the price of a room on Airbnb
    - If hotel price and Airbnb room price do not differ more than 10%, go for hotel.
    > Booking is done either directly with the hotel, online travel agents such as Trip Advisor, Expedia or Triviago or Airbnb. (`Transaction #2`)
4. Around 1 month before trip - start planning activities for the trip. Normally, planning resources include travel blogs, review sites or word of mouth.
    - Plan which places of interest to visit
    - Plan what to eat in general (not necessarily by meals)
5. While planning for the trip, transportation planning come into play as well i.e. travel via public transport or hire vehicle or hire driver?
    > Vehicle hire or driver hire is normally done with the hire company/agent. (`Transaction #3`)

**What are some pain-points or frictions with this process flow?**
1. `Trip budgeting` cannot be done properly due to late planning or lack of plan for activities during trip
    > Current methodology seems to be "let's nail the big spend first i.e. flights and accomodation and worry about the rest later"
    - Poor documentation for trip budget - difficult to reference and respond during trip

2. `Trip planning documentation` cannot be done properly due to transactions with multiple parties to complete a travel i.e. flights, accomodations, transportation plan, activities plan etc.
    > There is currently no good way to have a travel pack consisting all information on the travel i.e. flight itineraries, accomodation bookings, travel budget, activities plan, transportation plan, activities/tour bookings, food plans etc.

3. There is no good way to `validate travel plan` except consulting travel blogs and travel reviews
    > The most important limitation while travelling is "`time`". Poor planning leads to loss of time. So, there might be some value in getting someone to validate the plans and provide feedbacks and guidance before proceeding or even having a local travel buddy just to guide you around.

4. The well-advertised food and shopping destinations online are mostly places "catered" for tourists. Downsides include extra markup to capitalize on the ignorance of travellers from abroad and inability to truly experience the local experience.
    > What if someone `local help` with research and recommendations based on their understanding of their culture?

5. `Transportation planning` might be difficult without proper understanding of the local transportation infrastructure.
    > Who would know best if not the locals?

6. `Language barrier` when travelling to a country speaking foreign language

**Understanding the Travel Guide Economics**
- Traditionally, a travel agency hire tour guides to execute the travel package that they have curated based on their connections and calculated returns.
- The travel package generally has a huge margin due to economies of scale i.e. a tour guide with a van or bus of travellers
- However, most of the profits are earned by the travel agents while the travel guides only earn a fraction of the profit
    > Need to collect more data and survey to get concrete numbers on the economics of travel guides..

**Proposed Solution**
- A platform connecting local tour guide or host with travellers
    - For `travellers`, this will be a solution to help them package their trip into one through proper planning and documentations with the help of a local guide
    - For `local guides`, this will be an opportunity for them to either passively help with the travellers' planning or actively guide travellers as a travel buddy/guide depending on the requirements of the travellers.
